## Jiji Web scrape

This package was created to scrape products from <a href="https://jiji.ng/">Jiji website</a>
But initially created to scrape cars data.
It can be use to scrape other product, I will create a base class later.


**Instructions:**

* First make sure you have `python` installed on your machine.
* And you're in the same directory where the `main.py` and `requirements.txt` are, before running the following commands.
* First install all the requirements by running `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Then run `python main.py` and wait till the scrapping finish. ðŸ˜‰
* Or try `python3` instead of `python` if that doesn't work for you.
* GOOD LUCK!
